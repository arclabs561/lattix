# Knowledge Graph Construction and Embedding Inference

# Pipeline:
#   anno (extraction) → lattice (KG) → rank-retrieve (retrieval)

# Crates:
#   lattice-core   - Triple, Entity, Relation, KnowledgeGraph types
#   lattice-embed  - KGE inference (TransE/RotatE via ONNX)
#   lattice        - Facade crate re-exporting all
